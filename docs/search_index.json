There is increasing awareness being developed on the rights and to maintain caution related to gun laws. Considering this, we wanted to explore how the changes in gun laws and awareness has changed the pattern in the occurrence of gun related crime in New York City. Questions to Explore: Which places in the New York City neighbourhood are the safest from gun violence? On the other end of the spectrum, what are the riskiest neighbourhoods? Is there any association between safety of a neighbourhood and the average income of the neighborhood? Is there a crime trend in terms of an hour of the day/day of the week/month of the year/season or other parameters where the number of violent crimes spike? Studying the demographics of victims and perpetrators. Which age-group/race/gender of victims are at more-risk? Which age-group/race/gender of perpetrators pose more-risk? Is there a correlation between the age-group/gender/race of victims and perpetrators? "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources 2.0.1 Main Data Source: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nypd-shooting-incident-data-historic The above data source contains all the shooting events in NYC from 2006 to 2019. The NYPD documents all the shooting events that take place in the city and update the same every quarter. The Office of Management Analysis and Planning reviews the events before being posted to the website. There are ~21k records and the attributes of each shooting include data, time and location of the event along with perpetrator and victim demographics (age, race, gender). Number of Rows: 21626 Number of Columns: 19 Each shooting event is identified by the INCIDENT KEY for that event. However, if there are multiple victims or perpetrators, the same incident key is repeated. There are 5 boroughs namely Manhattan, Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens and Staten Island. There are 76 Precincts across the five boroughs. The data for the AGE GROUP of both perpetrators and victims are aggregated into groups in the raw data. It would be helpful if the exact age was available instead of the age groups. The buckets are &lt;18, 18-24, 25-44, 45-64, 65+ and UNKNOWN. The RACE for the perpetrator and victim are factors with values AMERICAN INDIAN/ALASKAN NATIVE, ASIAN / PACIFIC ISLANDER, BLACK, BLACK HISPANIC, WHITE, WHITE HISPANIC and UNKNOWN. Location of the shooting incident is present in both Latitute-Longitude format and the GeoPoint format. 2.0.2 Supplementary Data: https://data.cccnewyork.org/data/table/66/median-incomes#66/107/62/a/a The above data source contains the zipcode wise median income across NYC. Each precinct is an aggregation of multiple zip codes and hence this is a more granular data. There is also aggregated income data available at borough and district level. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation Data cleaning is one of the major tasks before doing the data exploration. The data we used had some missing values but they were read as empty strings. Doing null value analysis on empty strings is difficult, so the empty strings were converted into NA for all the columns. The data had some misprints in the age for perpetrators. Ages such as 1020, 940, 224 which cannot be possible in reality were present. Such values were removed from the dataset. We also created some additional columns of day of week, year, month, day so as to directly use these columns in data exploration. The interactive graph generated required data to be in a different form and also multiple files were generated for it which can be seen in the data folder "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values Row-wise distribution of Missing Data We can see that the recent data has more missing values for the perpetrator details compared to the older data. We hypothesize that it could be because it takes time to find the criminal or because of only improved skills of the criminals that they arent being caught. Overlap of missing data in various columns. The graph shows us a holistic view of the missing data columns in the dataset. The dots when marked mean that the value is missing in all those columns. For example, the first bar shows that location description is missing. Whereas the second bar indicates that the 4 columns - Location and Perpetrator age, sex, and race are all missing. You can observe that the missing proportion of perpetrator info is increasing over the years. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results", " Chapter 5 Results We looked at the locations at which the shootings take place, and if recorded. The majority of the shooting events happen in dwellings compared to social gathering locations. One hypothesis is that this statistic is skewed because of events that are either related to cases of robbery or homicide. We observed that the frequency of shootings is least in February and constantly increases until the middle of the year (July-August) before it starts to fall towards the end. While reading about the trend, we came across a research that also observed a similar trend in all types of crimes which validated our hypothesis. *Reference research paper: https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ics.pdf We explored the pattern between the number of shootings and the day of the week, and could clearly see a trend in terms of higher cases of gun violence over the weekends. Monday-Thursday are very much the same, and Friday-Sunday are the same but at a higher level of cases. We are of the information that the number of shooting events across the United States are on a rise. We decided to put this information to a test, and we were proven wrong atleast in the case of New York City. The number of shooting incidents have definitely been going down over the years from 2006 to 2019 and Staten Island happens to be one of the safest neighbourhoods throughout while Brooklyn happens to be the most violent. Since we saw a clear trend in the Month of the year and Day of the week, we were strongly inclined to see if there was a trend in the Hour of the day and the frequency of shootings. There is a clear trend where majority of the shootings happen after dusk and before dawn (7PM-4AM). Since we observed that there was such a stark difference between the number of shootings based on the time when there is darkness, we thought that the seasons might also affect and have a correlation with the time of the shootings. Except during June-November where the shooting events are highly skewed towards the night-time, all the other months do not really have the same trend and are infact almost evenly spread out through the day. We wanted to geospatially map the precinct level incidents to the map of New York and see the regions that are highest in terms of gun violence. We wanted to use this information and correlate it to our existing information about the New York City. We clearly know that the salaries are in the order of: Manhattan (~$94k) &gt; Staten Island (~$90k) &gt; Queens (~$75k) &gt; Brooklyn (~$66k) &gt; Bronx (~$41k). We can see that the frequency increases as the salary of the neighbourhood decreases. This graph highlights the male female distribution of the victims. The percentage of females is very less irrespective of the borough considered. It is less that 0.5% in all boroughs except Brooklyn where it just crosses the 0.5% mark. The y axis has the precincts seperated borough wise and ordered in the order of % of male victims. Brooklyn, followed by Bronx have the highest %of male victims. The graph clearly shows that the males are at a very high risk of being shot in all the boroughs. The gender percentage difference is most prominent in Bronx but many precincts in Manhattan have a comparable gender distribution. This graph highlights the race borough distribution of number of shootings. It is not a good practice to have varying scales but since the data distribution is not uniform, we have used a different scale for number of shootings below 100 and highligted them in green and the numbers above 100 are shown in red. Staten Island has the least number of attacks as most of the tiles corresponding to it are in green. Blacks are at the highest risk in all boroughs. American Indian/ Alaskan Native are attacked the least and Brooklyn has the highest number of shootings. Graphs have only been constructed for top 3 races with the highest contribution in the victim population as these races are in the red zone in the above graph. It can be clearly observed that the Blacks are at the highest risk in all boroughs. But the proportion of attacks in Brooklyn is the highest and it is the the lowest in Bronx and it is completely opposite for White Hispanic as the attacked proportion is the least for them in Brooklyn and the most in Bronx. Queens has the highest proportion difference between black hispanic and white hispanic. From the Alluvial graph, it can be seen that the proportion of people below 18 years of age is the same in perpetrators as well as the victims. People between 18-44 years of age are the most active in both groups. The proportion of people in 45-64 is less in perpetrators when compared to victims. Perpetrators tend to attack more in their similar age groups. In general, the attacks from a particular age group drops as the victim age group moves away from the attackers age group. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component For the interactive plot below, we can see and compare the shooting frequency each month at a Borough level by selecting the years and the borough you want to compare. The chart lets you choose one borough and multiple years. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion Our approach to the exploratory analysis on the New York Shooting incidents was to: Hypothesize the reason for gun violence Obtain supplementary data and research about reasons for crime and violence Understand the overall data from 2006 to 2019 and also individually at a granular level based on year and neighbourhood Who are the people and where are the areas most of the shooting events happen We hypothesized that Gun Violence in terms of shooting events are highly correlated to the neighbourhood income level, time of the day and the time of the year. There is significant research on the seasonality of crimes and their reasons. We observed the similar trends to hold true with our data related to New York City. We found out that the income levels of the neighbourhood is a very significant factor for where the shooting events occur along with the race of both the victim and the perpetrator. Similarly, the location of the shooting has a high correlation with the neighbourhood in which the shooting occurs. We can see a lot of summary trends which hold true and one can understand the pattern of crimes and shootings based on these observations. 7.0.1 References: Understanding Multiple Line Charts https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/line_several_group.html Understanding Multiple checkboxes https://bl.ocks.org/johnnygizmo/531991a77047112b7ca89f78b840fba5 Understanding Filters https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/barplot_button_data_simple.html "]]
